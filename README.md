# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Anthony Ochoa
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
My problem domain is to create an app that allows me to search a city's location and weather. It also is an assignment that helps build my knowledge as a learning developer to understand the use and implementation of API's as well as the back end of Software Developement. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The first steps are downloading all of the necessary software to get into vista code and have a terminal. We use Ubuntu. 
After that, you need to create a server; download all of the necessary items such as express, doteven, cors. 
Once you've created a server using your server.js file you have to link everything together, you can use your terminal to do that. This is also where you will link your PORT. 
From there you work mainly inside your server.js. Though there is a tremendous amount of data that may that can come from your json files as well as any api's

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We are using a pre-built front end, the libraries we are using are a location.json file and a weather.json file. As well as being connected to a server.js PORT 3000 where we can upload things in real time. We are primarily using Jquery. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
Since I did not this in real time the only time stamp I have is when it was live from my github -January 2nd 0640AM
## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
--> A lot of credit goes to Dawit Ayana, he helped me a lot throughout this process. I also followed along with the Frontrow video
