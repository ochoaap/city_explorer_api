# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Anthony Ochoa
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
My problem domain is to create an app that allows me to search a city's location and weather. It also is an assignment that helps build my knowledge as a learning developer to understand the use and implementation of API's as well as the back end of Software Developement.
